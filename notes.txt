create reduction rules special for printing nice names and incorporate them into repl

document the reduction rule and ingredient specification languages
- reduction rule syntax, especially the lhs. explain the kind of info the type_checker works with
- qualified ingredient variable and how it has to do with inheritance. include that things always count as inheriting themselves
- mixture reduction rule syntax
- ingredient specification: name, abstract, inherit being special
- the --- to separate ingdts in same file
- keywords like None and filename that shouldn't be used in ingredients
- idea of abstract ingdts as ones that will never show up
- idea of multiple inheritance and overridding order
- descriptions of the various actions that can go into ingdt attributes and the keywords that can go with them (like SELF with yield)


It's a little weird that tags for ingredients are done via inheritance and tags for modifiers are decalred with rules.

I feel like reduction rules do too much of the work, and ingredient definitions do barely anything

Thoughts...
- more action effect attributes like gain_mod and yield to take some of the work from reduction rules
- maybe put some reduction rule info directly into the ingredient def in the form of attributes?
  like maybe what happens when mixed with water can be an attribute?
- A mixes_into attribute that says that when you have a mixture with the thing then it goes into the other thing?
- Perhaps an absorbs attribute in the opposite direction? Like Dough should absorb Sugar, or most things really
- Maybe certain attributes on ingredients can automatically be converted into reduction rules on parsing?
- Maybe modifiers can have specification system just like ingredients, with tags working like inheritance, and with attributes driving reduction.
  maybe we can do away with reduction rules if that ends up being good
